This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## About this project

This project is an army builder for [Fantasy Flight's Star Wars Legion](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-legion), but the main focus at the moment is a personal playground. The army builder is not functional right now. There still is a lot of work to be done.
